# 🧪 Aggression Effects: An Experimental Data Analysis
**Quantifying Behavioral Drivers through Python-Based Statistical Modeling**

### **🎯 The Challenge**
Behavioral aggression is rarely driven by a single factor. The goal of this project was to analyze experimental data to determine how **demographic variables** and **situational triggers** interact to influence aggressive behavior. 

### **🛠️ Technical Methodology**
* **Experimental Design:** Analyzed a factorial design setup to evaluate multiple independent variables simultaneously.
* **Two-Way ANOVA:** Implemented using Python to test for main effects and interaction effects.
* **Hypothesis Testing:** Evaluated $p$-values and effect sizes to determine statistical significance and practical relevance.
* **Assumptions Checking:** Validated normality and homogeneity of variance (Levene’s test) to ensure the robustness of the ANOVA model.

### 🔑 **Key Research Competencies**
This project serves as a technical benchmark for my approach to behavioral data science:
* **Statistical Rigor:** Moving beyond descriptive metrics to model complex **interaction effects** via Two-Way ANOVA.
* **Reproducible Research:** Python implementation designed for scalability and auditability in a scientific context.
* **Experimental Fluency:** Demonstrated expertise in variable control, hypothesis testing, and validating model assumptions.

### **💡 Key Insights**
* **Interaction Effects:** Identified specific conditions where demographic and situational factors converged to significantly amplify aggressive responses.
* **Data-Driven Conclusions:** Translated raw experimental outputs into a structured research write-up focused on behavioral predictability.
* **Visualization:** Used Matplotlib/Seaborn to plot interaction lines, making complex statistical overlaps easy for stakeholders to visualize.
